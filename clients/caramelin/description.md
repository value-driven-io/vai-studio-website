“Caramel'in”:  New Brand Concept 

Salut Nicole & Jerome,
Here is a detailed look at the rebranding concept for Caramel'in. The goal of this document is to lay out a complete vision that you can get excited about. It starts with a clear look at where the cafe stands today and then dives into the creative story and all the practical pieces you need—from the logo and menus to the signs and website.

Part 1: Status Quo
Before creating a brand concept, it’s always important for me to understand the foundation we're building on. So I did some research, looked at what people are saying online and checked out the other food spots in the area to get a clear picture (at the end of this document you find the online sources that research is referring to).

Online Reviews: What People Already Love About Caramel'in
Caramel'in is already a famous spot in Maharepa, and that's its biggest strength. People, both locals and tourists, count on it. Here’s what they praise online about:
Good Food Quality: The French pastries, cakes, and desserts get amazing reviews. People also love the high-quality Illy coffee (compared to other places around) and the fact that the savory food—from the Poisson Cru to the cheeseburgers—is a great variety and quite tasty.1
Great Value: In a place like Moorea where things can be expensive, customers notice and appreciate that Caramel'in offers good food at very reasonable prices.1
Friendly Vibe: The staff is in the review generally described as friendly, sweet, and welcoming, which makes people want to come back again.1

The Challenges
Running Out of Food: The most common frustration customers mention is the cafe running out of popular menu items, especially around lunchtime.3 This is likely because the food is so popular, but it's a key issue to solve.
No Digital Front Door: Right now, Caramel'in doesn't have its own website or active social media (which you guys are changing now already).4 This means: Brands need to have some push at the start to get people on board, believe the new story and follow you. The current branding has been around for a while, so deciding for a new look that matches your vision for the future is the best step forward.2

The Opportunity
Looking at other restaurants in Maharepa, there's a clear gap in the market. There are the very high-end, expensive restaurants that sell the “lagoon view”, and there are the simple, casual roulottes/"snacks." (like Snack Mahana, Chez FouFou).6 Caramel'in is positioned to be the best of both worlds: a place that offers tasty, quality food and best coffee in a nicely designed, welcoming space, but without the formality or high prices. Your location in the center of town is perfect for becoming the heart of the community.8

Part 2: The Idea – "The Caramel'in Newspaper"
This brings me to the creative concept. Instead of just being a cafe, we'll re-imagine Caramel'in as the home of the local "Caramel'in Newspaper".
The idea is not about being old-school/traditional, I imagine more a creative mix of two styles:
The Classic Newspaper: The design will be based on the timeless charm of a vintage newspaper—using beautiful textured paper, classic fonts, and a clean layout.
Moorea's Island Spirit: We’ll bring the newspaper to life with descent but vibrant and colorful, retro-style illustrations that "pop" off the page (in the style of the images you shared with me Nicole - upper right corner). The goal is to combine a traditional cafe branding with the “fruity” spirit of the island (and actually the both of you).


A Note from the Publishers (Your Story)
To make this personal and share your values, we’ll feature a message from you on the menu and website. It’s a chance to talk about your philosophy, including your focus on local and sustainable sourcing. Here’s an example:
"Welcome to Caramel'in. For years, this cafe has been a meeting point for our community. Our dream is to honor that history by turning this place into a living storybook of Moorea. We believe in simple things done exceptionally well: a perfect croissant, a rich cup of coffee, and a warm 'Ia Ora na'.
Everything we serve has a story, from the local fisherman who brings us our tuna to the family that grows our pineapples. We believe in celebrating Moorea's community, which means sourcing locally whenever we can and being thoughtful about our impact on this beautiful island. This isn't just a cafe; it's our daily touch-point in the island we love. Mauruuru, and enjoy today’s edition."
– Nicole & Jerome

The People Behind the Pages (Involve the Team)
We already talked about the importance, so let's introduce your team and make them part of the story! A section on the menu or website called "Meet the Team" with a team photo and short bios will bring personality to the brand and make your staff feel like they are really part of the show.

Part 3: How It Looks & Feels – The Visuals
This is how we bring Caramel'in s new branding to life.
The Logo: We’ll create a new "Caramel'in" logo in a retro script, inspired by the colorful image you sent me in one of your mails (top right, but I recommend not to take the dark design). This will be your main logo for social media, documents, and the signs.
Colors: The color palette will be a mix of vintage and tropical. The base will be a warm, sandy beige (like aged paper) and a soft charcoal black (like ink). Then, we’ll use similar vibrant accent colors from your inspiration image—Hibiscus Coral, Mango Orange, Lagoon Turquoise, and Emerald Green—for the illustrations and to make things pop. Inspired by polynesian colors.9
Illustrations (optional but would give the fine touch): This could be the core of the style. Instead of photos, we’ll use custom, hand-drawn illustrations in that colorful, retro travel-poster style (maybe some collab with a local budget-friendly artist?). We can have beautiful drawings of coffee beans, fish, vanilla plants, hibiscus flowers, pineapples, and scenes of Moorea life.11
Polynesian Touch: We can add subtle, geometric Polynesian patterns—like niho mano (shark teeth)—as borders or textures to add a layer of authentic cultural detail in a stylish way.13

Part 4: The Project Checklist
Here’s how this concept applies directly to the items on your list you mentioned in your mail.
1. The Menus
Your clipboard idea is perfect for the newspaper concept. Each menu is a different "page" of the “Newspaper”.
Design: Each menu will be a single, beautifully designed page on a clipboard, with a newspaper layout, classic text, and colorful illustrations.
Sections (some examples, based on the component you outlined):
"The Daily" (All Day): The Drinks & Snacking menu.
"The Morning Edition" (6:30am - 11am): Breakfast menu.
"Midday Specials" (11am - 3pm): Lunch menu.
"Social Sunset" (3pm - 6pm): Tapas/Happy Hour menu.
"The Sweet Section" (All Day): Pastry & Cake menu.
"Breaking News!" (optional): Chalkboard for daily specials.

2. The Signs (7 total)
We will design all-new signs using the new logo and visual style for the 4 signs on the road and the 3 around the terrace. They should be eye-catching and reflect the new Caramel'in brand.
3. The Bar
We can make the bar a centerpiece. Ideas: Custom-painted sign with the new logo, decorating the bar front with a subtle polynesian pattern, or displaying drink/snack specials on a large chalkboard designed like a newspaper front page.
4. The Logo & Packaging (optional for a nice touch)
I’d like to think of creating a new logo matching all your needs and the holistic concept. The newspaper combined with polynesian theme could be perfect for packaging, too (ideally sustainable, locally made - maybe your staff has ideas (like bamboo boxes for cutlery, etc.)?):
Coffee Cups & To-Go Bags: Could be designed to look like they are wrapped in pages from "The Caramel'in Newspaper."
For Fries: Create paper cones/boxes from the "newspaper print" design.
5. The Website
My recommendation: Create a simple, beautiful newspaper-like website that works as a digital version of the overall concept, featuring your story, clear menus, opening hours, team photo, little about section incl. your values, news/events and location.

Part 5: Future Ideas – Building Community 
The "Newspaper" concept can grow. In the future, Caramel'in could become a real-life news spot for Maharepa, with a community bulletin board for local events, dance classes, workshops and local markets. You could host "Weekend Edition" events with live music or local artists, to make Caramel'in a central part of Moorea's cultural life plus earning a spot inside the tourism magazine.15
