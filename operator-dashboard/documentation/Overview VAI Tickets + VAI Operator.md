1. Crisp and Compact
VAI is French Polynesia's unified booking platform, empowering local tour operators with an enterprise-grade booking management system (VAI Operator) while offering visitors a single, seamless app to discover and book authentic island experiences all over French Polynesia (VAI Tickets).
2. The Essentials
VAI is a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed to unify and empower French Polynesia's tourism industry. It consists of two integrated platforms:
VAI Operator: A powerful, free-to-use business management system for local tour and activity providers. It gives them the tools to manage their activities, schedules, real-time bookings, market them for the whole of French Polynesia and secure international payments, all while charging a fair commission.
VAI Tickets: A multi-language mobile first web-app for tourists. It acts as a one-stop shop to discover, book, and communicate directly with a wide range of local activity providers across all five archipelagos, solving the problem of a fragmented market. One App. Instant Access. All Islands.
The core purpose of VAI is to stop revenue leakage to overseas companies and establish "Digital Sovereignty" by providing a world-class, locally-built alternative to platforms like Viator and TripAdvisor.
3. Detailed Description
VAI is a dual-platform, enterprise-grade digital ecosystem conceived and built entirely in French Polynesia to solve the critical challenges facing the local tourism industry. Its overarching purpose is to establish Digital Sovereignty by creating a local champion to compete with foreign booking giants, thereby keeping revenue within the Fenua and empowering local businesses.
The VAI ecosystem addresses key market problems such as a fragmented booking landscape, significant revenue loss to high international commissions, and the difficulty for local operators to meet modern digital demands and regulatory requirements. It achieves this through two distinct but seamlessly integrated applications:
