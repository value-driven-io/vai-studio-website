# ðŸ’° Payment Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Stripe payment management into VAI Operator Dashboard, connecting with the existing payment system in VAI Tickets. This enables full end-to-end payment processing with auth/capture flow.

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Integration**
- **Updated Queries**: Added payment fields (`payment_status`, `payment_intent_id`, `stripe_fee`, `payment_captured_at`) to all booking queries
- **Enhanced Revenue Calculations**: Revenue now based on CAPTURED payments only, not just booking confirmations
- **New Metrics**: Added `authorized_revenue` tracking for pending captures

### 2. **Payment Service Layer**
- **`paymentService.js`**: Comprehensive payment management service
  - `capturePayment()`: Captures authorized Stripe payments
  - `refundPayment()`: Handles refunds and cancellations
  - `getPaymentStatus()`: Retrieves payment info from Stripe
  - `formatPaymentInfo()`: UI helper for payment display

### 3. **Supabase Edge Functions**
- **`capture-payment`**: Stripe payment capture API
- **`refund-payment`**: Smart refund/cancel handling (auth vs captured)
- **`get-payment-status`**: Payment status retrieval with fee calculation

### 4. **Business Logic Integration**
- **Automatic Payment Capture**: When operator confirms booking, payment is captured
- **Automatic Refunds**: When operator declines booking, payment is refunded
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with manual Stripe fallback
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback for payment actions

### 5. **UI Components**
- **`PaymentStatusIndicator`**: Visual payment status with badges and details
- **`PaymentActionButtons`**: Manual capture/refund controls with Stripe dashboard links
- **Enhanced BookingDetailModal**: Complete payment information in Financial tab
- **Enhanced BookingsList**: Payment status column in table view

### 6. **Revenue Accuracy**
- **Captured Revenue Only**: Stats now show actual captured payments
- **Stripe Fee Deduction**: Proper accounting for processing fees
- **Authorized vs Captured**: Separate tracking for authorized pending payments

## ðŸ”„ Payment Flow

### Tourist Side (VAI Tickets)
1. Tourist books activity
2. Payment authorized (card charged but not captured)
3. Booking created with `payment_status: 'authorized'`

### Operator Side (Dashboard)
1. Operator sees booking with payment authorization indicator
2. **Confirm Booking** â†’ Automatically captures payment + updates status
3. **Decline Booking** â†’ Automatically refunds payment + updates status
4. **Manual Controls** â†’ Capture/refund buttons for edge cases
