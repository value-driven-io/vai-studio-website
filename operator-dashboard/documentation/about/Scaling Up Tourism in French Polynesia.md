What the Numbers Show

Current plan (short to medium term):
Under the "Fāri’ira’a Manihini 2027" strategy, French Polynesia aims to manage tourist numbers sustainably—capping them at around 280,000 to 300,000 visitors annually, in line with one tourist per local resident

Long-term ambition:
President Brotherson expressed a vision to significantly increase visitor numbers, targeting 600,000 tourists per year by 2033, but with the important condition that this growth must be balanced by redistributing tourism more evenly across the five archipelagos

Is This Realistic—and Will It Happen?

The distinction here is between short-term strategy (up to 2027) focused on quality and sustainability, and a long-range goal projected through 2033:

No official roadmap beyond 2027 has been publicly released or detailed yet, especially regarding infrastructure or capacity expansion needed to sustainably handle double the number of tourists.

Achieving 600,000 per year would require careful planning on multiple fronts: environmental impact, cultural preservation, local infrastructure, transportation, and equitable economic distribution across the islands.

That being said, framing clear long-term aspirations can help guide policy—even if the details aren't yet fully fleshed out.

What shifts or developments might be needed to hit that 2033 goal?

1. Transportation & Accessibility

Air capacity: Right now, the majority of international visitors arrive via Tahiti (Faa’a International Airport), which has limited runway and terminal capacity. To handle double the flow, either:

Major airport upgrades would be needed, or

New direct international routes to secondary islands (like Bora Bora, Rangiroa, or Marquesas) would need to open.

Cruise ships: Currently a niche market. Scaling cruises would increase arrivals but conflicts with sustainability goals (cruise tourism = high environmental impact, low local spending).

2. Accommodation & Infrastructure

Hotel capacity: French Polynesia has ~8,000 rooms (luxury resorts, pensions, guesthouses). Doubling tourists means significantly expanding capacity while avoiding overdevelopment.

Alternative stays: Guesthouses, eco-lodges, and homestays could distribute tourism more evenly across archipelagos.

Utilities: Water, energy, and waste management systems would need massive investment. Islands like Bora Bora already face water shortages.

3. Tourism Distribution

Right now, most visitors concentrate in Society Islands (Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora).

To avoid over-tourism, the government would need to shift flows to:

Tuamotus (diving, eco-tourism)

Marquesas (culture, hiking, heritage)

Australs & Gambier (remote, niche experiences)

This requires better inter-island connectivity (air + sea).

4. Environmental & Cultural Sustainability

French Polynesia markets itself as a high-value, low-volume destination. Doubling tourists risks undermining that brand.

Solutions might include:

Strict visitor caps per island (like Bora Bora’s lagoon management).

Expanding marine protected areas.

Promoting longer stays instead of just more arrivals.

Cultural integration: ensuring local communities benefit (jobs, income) while preserving Polynesian traditions.

5. Policy & Investment Needs

Government strategy: The Fāri’ira’a Manihini 2027 plan is short-term. A FM2033 plan would need to define:

Infrastructure expansion roadmap

Public-private partnerships for hotels, airports, ferries

Environmental safeguards

Funding: Likely a mix of local government, France (since Polynesia is an overseas collectivity), and international investors.

Workforce: Training locals for hospitality, guiding, and eco-tourism roles.
