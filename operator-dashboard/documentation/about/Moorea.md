Executive Summary
French Polynesia's tourism sector, a cornerstone of its economy, is navigating a period of strategic transformation. The industry is characterized by a high-value, low-volume model, with an average tourist expenditure of 380,000 XPF per visit. However, an ambitious government mandate to nearly double visitor arrivals to 600,000 by 2033 is creating significant market pressures, challenging this traditional paradigm. The operator landscape is defined by a two-tier structure: a core group of approximately 38 officially licensed, large-scale travel agencies and Destination Management Companies (DMCs) that curate comprehensive travel packages, and a highly fragmented "long tail" of over 4,500 smaller enterprises that deliver specialized, on-the-ground experiences. This report finds that the official lists of licensed operators significantly understate the true scale and diversity of the activity provider market, which is most accurately represented through the digital marketplaces of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Viator and GetYourGuide.

The analysis reveals a complementary, rather than competitive, ecosystem across the territory's three main islands. Tahiti serves as the cultural and administrative gateway, with a diverse offering of coastal tours, 4x4 interior safaris, and urban experiences. Moorea is positioned as the "adventure island," with a market dominated by providers of ATV tours, hiking, and immersive marine activities such as whale watching and snorkeling with sharks and rays. Bora Bora remains the pinnacle of luxury, with its tour offerings almost exclusively centered on its world-famous lagoon, featuring private boat charters, high-end water sports, and romantic excursions tailored to a high-budget clientele. As the market expands, operators face a critical choice: scale to serve a growing mid-market, largely driven by a renewed focus on cruise tourism, or double down on exclusive, sustainable, and high-end experiences that preserve the destination's premium allure.

Section 1: Economic Pillar: The Role of Tourism in French Polynesia
The tour and activity sector in French Polynesia is the primary engine of a national industry that is both economically vital and at a strategic crossroads. Understanding the macroeconomic context is essential to analyzing the operator landscape, as business decisions are directly influenced by national tourism policies, visitor demographics, and economic performance.

1.1 Key Performance Indicators of the Tourism Economy
The economic significance of tourism in French Polynesia is demonstrated by several key metrics. In 2023, the territory welcomed 305,700 visitors, a figure composed of 261,813 land-based tourists and 43,815 cruise passengers. This distinction is critical, as the consumption patterns and activity demands of these two groups differ significantly. Forecasts for 2024 anticipate a substantial 18.9% increase in cruise passengers, highlighting this segment as a key driver of near-term growth.   

Financially, the sector's contribution is profound. It generated 99 billion XPF in 2023, a marked increase from 77 billion XPF in the previous year. This revenue stream accounts for an estimated 8% to 12% of French Polynesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The destination maintains a high-value positioning, with the average tourist spending approximately 380,000 XPF per visit, a figure that excludes international airfare.   

This economic activity is a cornerstone of the labor market. As of the first quarter of 2024, tourism was directly responsible for 13,338 jobs, representing 18.1% of all employment in French Polynesia. This underscores the sector's deep socio-economic importance across the islands.   

1.2 Strategic Growth Ambitions and Market Pressures
The current government, led by President Moetai Brotherson, has articulated a clear and ambitious growth strategy, aiming to attract 600,000 tourists annually by the year 2033. This target, which represents a near-doubling of 2023 visitor levels, marks a significant policy shift toward expansion. Such an aggressive goal will inevitably create both opportunities for operators to capture new demand and immense pressure on the territory's infrastructure, natural environment, and service quality.   

This push for growth places the established high-value, low-volume tourism model at a strategic inflection point. The high average spend per visitor has long been a hallmark of the destination's brand. However, achieving a target of 600,000 annual visitors cannot be accomplished solely by expanding the top-tier luxury market; it necessitates attracting a broader and more diverse market segment. This dynamic creates a fundamental tension between volume and value, forcing operators to consider whether to cater to the growing mass market or reinforce their focus on exclusivity.

A central element of this new strategy is the reversal of a previous pledge to ban large cruise ships. While welcoming larger vessels is a clear tactic to boost arrival numbers, it places the national government's economic objectives in direct conflict with local preservation efforts. In Bora Bora, for instance, the local council and tourism association have moved to protect their luxury brand by implementing a daily cap of 1,200 cruise passenger arrivals. This creates a fractured policy environment where operators in Papeete may benefit from the high volume of passengers disembarking from large ships, while their counterparts in Bora Bora must adhere to a more restrictive, quality-focused business model.   

1.3 Market Dependency
French Polynesia's tourism market exhibits a significant dependency on a small number of source regions. Tourists from North America and Europe account for 28.3% and 48.4% of market share, respectively, meaning that over three-quarters of all visitors originate from these two continents. This heavy concentration poses an economic risk, as downturns in these key markets could disproportionately impact the local economy. Consequently, there is a strategic imperative to diversify visitor sources, with a particular focus on developing the Asian market to build long-term resilience.

Land-Based Adventure: This is a cornerstone of the Moorea experience. ATV/Quad tours are exceptionally popular, providing an exhilarating way to explore the island's interior, including its vast pineapple plantations and scenic viewpoints like the Belvedere Lookout, which offers panoramic views of both Cook's and Opunohu Bays.   

4x4 safari tours and guided hiking excursions are also widely available, catering to visitors eager to explore the island's lush valleys and mountains.   

Lagoon & Marine Excursions: The most ubiquitous water-based activity in Moorea is the lagoon tour featuring snorkeling with blacktip reef sharks and stingrays. This experience is offered by nearly every boat tour operator and takes place in shallow, crystal-clear sandbars where visitors can safely interact with the marine life.   

Whale Watching: Moorea is a premier destination for seasonal (August to November) humpback whale watching. Many operators offer small-group tours that provide opportunities to not only observe but also swim with these gentle giants in the open ocean, a high-value and transformative experience for many tourists. Companies like    

Corallina Tours and Moorea Expedition are prominent in this specialized field.

Unique Water Activities: The competitive market in Moorea has led to the development of differentiated products. Lagoon Explorer offers guided tours in transparent kayaks, allowing for a unique view of the coral gardens below. Other specialized offerings include tours on    

glass-bottom boats and excursions on luxury floating lounges, provided by operators like Akivai Lagoon Adventures, which cater to a clientele seeking comfort combined with adventure.   

Cultural Experiences: While adventure is the main draw, cultural tourism is also present. The Tiki Village provides a reconstructed traditional Polynesian village setting for cultural immersion, including spectacular evening dance shows and dinners. Additionally, highly-rated street food tours offer an authentic taste of local cuisine, which is a blend of Polynesian, French, and Chinese influences.
