## Key Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Confirmed
1. **Architecture:** Monorepo (embed code lives in `tourist-app/src/embed/`)
2. **Styling:** Inline CSS (no Tailwind in button script - keep bundle <10KB)
3. **i18n:** English only for MVP (iframe shows localized Tourist App)
4. **Analytics:** Stubbed for MVP (full system built post-launch)
5. **Documentation:** Written during beta testing (Week 3-4)

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Assign frontend developer
- Assign backend developer
- Validate 6-week timeline with team capacity

## Quick Start (For Developers)

### To Build Embed Widget:

2. Review Section 5 (Critical Alignment Questions)
3. Confirm all decisions with Kevin
4. Start Week 1 tasks (setup `src/embed/` directory)

### To Understand Analytics:
1. Read **[../analytics/VAI_UNIFIED_ANALYTICS_SYSTEM.md](../analytics/VAI_UNIFIED_ANALYTICS_SYSTEM.md)**
