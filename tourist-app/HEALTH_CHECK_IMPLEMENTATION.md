## 🚨 Safety Principles

1. **NEVER BREAK FUNCTIONALITY** - If unsure, log and skip
2. **Keep all error/warn console statements** - Only remove debug logs
3. **Test each change incrementally** - No bulk changes
4. **Backup before major changes** - Git commits per task
5. **Document all changes** - Clear commit messages
