-- üîê HYBRID RLS SECURITY FIX
-- Implements secure booking function + granular RLS policies
-- Timestamp: 2025-09-21 17:00:00 UTC

-- ================================
-- STEP 1: IMMEDIATE FIX - Make booking function SECURITY DEFINER
-- ================================

-- Verify the change

-- STEP 2: GRANULAR RLS POLICIES FOR APPLICATION ACCESS
-- ================================
