The Story of a Success
Market Context
The Polynesian tourism sector generates 99 billion XPF annually but suffers from a massive economic bleed: the 4,500+ local operators lose 20-30% of their revenue to international platforms (Viator, GetYourGuide). This represents an annual leakage of 3-5 billion XPF.
The VAI Solution: Digital Sovereignty
VAI is not just a booking platform. It is the digital infrastructure for Polynesian tourism, built locally, for locals:
Revolutionary Commission: 11% (vs. 20-30% for competitors)
Fast Payouts: 7 days (vs. 30-60 days)
Integrated Channel Manager: Centralized management of all sales channels
100% Local: Profits are reinvested into the Polynesian economy
The Technological Asset: A Decisive Advantage
The founder has spent 18 months developing a comprehensive platform:
27,636 lines of production code
React 19 + Supabase architecture (real-time)
Integrated Stripe Connect (international payments)
6 languages, including Tahitian
Exceptional productivity: 4.6x to 11.5x the industry standard
Documented market value: 28,000,000 - 44,000,000 XPF

The Execution Strategy: Phased rollout from Moorea (Months 1-3) to Tahiti (Months 4-6) and consolidation (Months 7-9).

VAI Platform is not a project-in-progressâ€”it's an operational business with a major technological asset seeking the capital needed to conquer its market.
The equation is simple:
You invest: 12 million XPF
The founder contributes: 28-44 million XPF in assets
Year 1 Return: 40 million XPF in revenue
The Impact: The digital transformation of Polynesian tourism
This is a rare opportunity where public investment generates an immediate return while building the country's strategic infrastructure. The time is now. The platform is ready. The market is waiting.
