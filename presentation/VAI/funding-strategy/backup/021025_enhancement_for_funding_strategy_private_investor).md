## Framework for Editing Document 1: funding_strategy.json
This document requires the most significant transformation. We will restructure it around three core principles: changing the audience, changing the "ask," and changing the narrative.

1. Transformation 1: Change the Audience

From: Public Officials reviewing a grant application.

To: Fellow Citizens of the Fenua considering a personal investment.

Action Plan:

Rewrite the executive_summary to be more direct and emotional. Frame it as a collective opportunity for Polynesians to invest in their own digital future.

Change the tone from formal and bureaucratic to one of shared purpose and local pride.

2. Transformation 2: Change the "Ask" (The Most Critical Edit)

From: A "Funding Stack" requesting specific public aid (DAD, AEPE, PACE).   

To: A clear, simple, and attractive "Investment Offer" for the public.

Action Plan:

Remove: Delete the entire funding_stack section and the Strategic Allocation by Program section. These are irrelevant and confusing for a retail investor.   

Create: Add a new, prominent section near the top called "Our Investment Offer."

Define the Instrument: Propose a Convertible Bond (Obligation Convertible). This is the hybrid instrument that will appeal to their user base.

Define the Terms:

Annual Return: Offer a fixed 10% annual interest, paid quarterly. This directly matches the returns seen in other successful projects on the platform.   

Term: Set a clear term, for example, 4 or 5 years.

Upside: Clearly explain the "convertible" part in simple language—the opportunity for investors to become shareholders in VAI's future success.

3. Transformation 3: Change the Narrative

From: Justifying how expenses fit specific government programs.

To: Showcasing how the community's investment will be put to work.

Action Plan:

Keep the detailed Year 1 Budget section, as its transparency is a major strength.   

Reframe the section titles. For example, instead of just "Strategic Personnel," add a subtitle like "Your Investment at Work: Building Our Local Team."

Rewrite the Conclusion to be a powerful call to action for local investors, emphasizing the dual benefit of a strong financial return and a profound community impact.

## Expanding the funding strategy for more credibility
Here are the specific areas where your funding strategy needs to be expanded to be more credible and robust for an investor audience.

1. Founder's Salary: The "Starving Founder" is a Risk, Not an Asset
The Issue: Your budget allocates 1,800,000 XPF annually to the founder. That is 150,000 XPF per month. While this shows immense personal sacrifice, an experienced investor will see this as a major liability.   

Why It's a Problem:

Burnout Risk: An underpaid founder is a financially stressed founder. Financial stress is a leading cause of distraction, poor decision-making, and eventual burnout. The founder is the single most important asset of the company; if you burn out, the entire investment fails.

Sustainability: It is not a sustainable long-term plan. Investors want to see that the company's leadership can be fully focused on the business for years to come, not worrying about personal bills.

Credibility: It can, paradoxically, look amateurish. It suggests you haven't fully considered the personal runway required to weather the immense stress of launching a startup.

Recommendation:

Raise the founder's salary. It doesn't need to be high, but it must be a livable wage for French Polynesia. A figure between 250,000 and 300,000 XPF per month (3M to 3.6M XPF annually) is far more realistic.

Justify it explicitly. Do not hide it. State clearly: "The founder's salary is set at a modest but sustainable level to ensure 100% focus on executing the business plan and mitigating founder burnout risk, which is a key success factor."

2. Company Vehicle: The Reality of "On-the-Ground Onboarding"
The Issue: Your budget has 700,000 XPF for "Inter-island travel," but no asset for ground transportation. Your goal is to onboard 250 operators across Moorea and Tahiti in the first year. This requires hundreds of in-person visits, meetings, and training sessions.   

Why It's a Problem: Relying on a personal vehicle (if you have one) or rentals is inefficient, costly over time, and unprofessional. What happens if it breaks down? How do you transport equipment for workshops?

Recommendation:

Add a line item for a company vehicle. This is not a luxury; it is essential operational equipment.

Be capital-efficient: Propose a long-term lease (location longue durée) for a modest, reliable vehicle (e.g., a used utility vehicle or small pickup). This avoids a large upfront capital expense. Budget approximately 50,000 - 70,000 XPF per month (600k - 840k XPF annually) for the lease and associated costs (insurance, fuel).

Justify it: "A dedicated company vehicle is critical for the high-touch, on-the-ground operator acquisition strategy, ensuring our team can efficiently conduct daily onboarding sessions, workshops, and support visits across the islands."

3. Marketing & Community: Budgeting for Trust
The Issue: Your marketing budget is well-structured but likely underfunded for the activities you've listed, especially "Workshops/Training" at 500,000 XPF for the year.   

Why It's a Problem: Your entire competitive advantage is built on local trust and community. This is not built through digital ads alone; it's built through face-to-face interaction. Workshops, launch events, and regular community meetups are your most powerful marketing tools. These events have real costs: venue rental, refreshments, marketing materials, etc.   

Recommendation:

Increase the Marketing & Acquisition budget.

Be more specific with line items:

Official Launch Event (Moorea & Papeete): Budget ~300,000 XPF. This is crucial for generating initial buzz and media coverage.

Quarterly Operator Workshops/Meetups: Increase the workshop budget to at least 800,000 XPF for the year to allow for more frequent, high-quality events.

Justify it: "A significant investment in community-building events is planned, as our go-to-market strategy prioritizes establishing deep trust and creating local brand ambassadors, which is our most defensible competitive moat."

Summary: A More Credible and Fundable Budget
By incorporating these critical items, you present a plan that is not just lean, but also realistic and built for success. It shows investors that you have thought through the operational realities of your strategy.

Here is a comparison of the budget structure:

Category	
Current Budget (XPF)    

Recommended Additions (XPF)	Revised Budget (XPF)
Personnel	8,262,000	+1,838,000 (Founder Salary + Charges)	10,100,000
Technology	1,720,000	0	1,720,000
Marketing	2,350,000	+600,000 (Events & Workshops)	2,950,000
Pro Services	1,430,000	0	1,430,000
Operations	2,800,000	+720,000 (Vehicle Lease)	3,520,000
Reserve	2,156,000	0	2,156,000
TOTAL	18,718,000	+3,158,000	~21,876,000
Your total funding "ask" should therefore be closer to 22 Million XPF. This is a far more defensible and credible number. It tells an investor that you are not just asking for the bare minimum to survive, but for the optimal amount required to succeed. This is a much more compelling proposition.

# Part 3
## Budget for Personal Costs

1. Are the Salaries for the New Hires Fair?
Blunt Answer: No, they are not fair or competitive.

Your current budget allocates 2,160,000 XPF annually for both the "Operator Success Manager" and the "Marketing & Community Lead". This is 180,000 XPF per month.   

Critical Analysis:

Market Reality: The gross minimum wage (SMIG) in French Polynesia is approximately 173,000 XPF per month. Your proposed salary is essentially minimum wage. The median gross salary is 235,100 XPF, and the average is even higher. A recent job posting for a Marketing Coordinator in Tahiti listed a range of 200,000 to 300,000 XPF.   

The Role's Importance: These are not entry-level administrative roles. The "Operator Success Manager" is your primary driver of B2B acquisition. The "Marketing & Community Lead" is responsible for building your most defensible asset: local trust. These roles require experience, a local network, autonomy, and strategic thinking.

The Risk to Investors: Offering minimum wage for strategic roles signals a critical misunderstanding of the local talent market. An investor will conclude one of two things: 1) You will fail to hire anyone qualified, jeopardizing the entire execution plan, or 2) You will hire a very junior person who will require extensive training and management, which you, as a solo founder, do not have the bandwidth for.

Recommendation:

You must increase these salaries to a competitive level. A realistic and defensible range would be 250,000 to 300,000 XPF per month for each role.

How to Justify It: Frame it as a strategic necessity. "To attract the high-quality, autonomous local talent required to execute our ambitious acquisition strategy, we have budgeted a competitive salary of 300,000 XPF/month. This investment ensures we can hire experienced professionals who can deliver results from day one, significantly de-risking our go-to-market plan."

Action: This will increase your total personnel costs and, therefore, your total funding "ask." This is a necessary and positive change that makes your plan more credible.

2. Should I Look for a Co-founder? And Should it be Communicated?
This is a profound strategic question.

Analysis:

You are a solo founder with deep technical and systems-thinking expertise. The business, however, has two distinct engines: the technology (your strength) and the on-the-ground, high-touch community and business development (a potential gap).   

The Argument FOR a Co-founder: Yes, in the long term, you should absolutely look for a co-founder. The ideal profile would be a well-respected local figure from the tourism or business community with deep commercial and operational expertise. This would massively de-risk the business for future investment rounds, provide invaluable local credibility, and share the immense psychological burden of leadership.

The Argument AGAINST Communicating It Now: No, you should not communicate this during this funding round. Announcing you are "looking for a co-founder" signals that your current team is incomplete and that the plan is contingent on finding a missing piece. It creates uncertainty and risk in the minds of investors. It can kill a deal.

Recommendation:

Adopt a two-phase strategy.

For This Funding Round (Now): Your pitch should be one of confident, solo leadership. The plan is to hire key employees—the Operator Success Manager and the Marketing Lead. Your budget and plan are solid and fundable with you as the sole founder and these key hires.

Post-Funding (Long-Term): Use the hiring process for the "Operator Success Manager" as a discreet "audition" for a potential co-founder. This role is perfectly positioned for it. If you find an exceptional candidate who demonstrates strategic leadership, deep market traction, and a shared vision, you can have a conversation about evolving their role into a C-level partner with equity after they have proven themselves within the company.

This approach allows you to secure your funding now based on a solid plan, while keeping the door open to finding the right strategic partner for the future.

## Budget for Tech Infrastructure and Setup

Line-by-Line Breakdown and Recommendations
Let's go through each item to see what an investor sees and what needs to change.

1. "Stripe Connect: 580,000 XPF (Setup + transaction fees)" >> Remove this line item entirely from the "Technological Infrastructure" budget.

Keep it where we strategically placed it: In the separate, top-level "Transactional & Payment Processing Costs" category as mentioned above. 

2. "Cloud & Hosting: 360,000 XPF (Supabase, Vercel, n8n)"
Analysis: 30,000 XPF per month. This is realistic for your current "pro plan" setup at low volume. It is not realistic for a platform with 250 active operators, thousands of daily tourist searches, and real-time booking/payment APIs firing constantly.

Investor's View: What happens during peak season? What is your plan for redundancy? Where is the budget for a proper staging/testing environment that mirrors production? This budget leaves no room for scaling or professional-grade reliability.

Recommendation:

Double this budget to at least 720,000 XPF (60,000 XPF/month).

Justify it: "This budget allows for a scalable architecture with dedicated production and staging environments, automated daily backups, and the capacity to handle peak season traffic without performance degradation, ensuring a reliable experience for both operators and tourists."

3. "Platform Maintenance: 240,000 XPF (Handled by founder)"
Analysis: This is a confusing line item. If this is meant to be part of your compensation, it should be in your salary. If it's for maintenance, what does it cover?

Investor's View: This is a classic "single point of failure" risk. The entire platform's maintenance rests on one person. What happens if you get sick, need a vacation, or are overwhelmed with strategic duties? Who fixes a critical bug at 2 AM?

Recommendation:

Re-label this to "External Technical Support & Contingency."

Increase it to at least 600,000 XPF.

Justify it: "This is a contingency fund to retain a freelance developer or agency on-demand for emergency bug fixes, security patches, and specialized tasks, mitigating the 'key person risk' and ensuring platform stability even when the founder is unavailable."

4. "Development Tools: 180,000 XPF" & "Telecommunications: 360,000 XPF"
Analysis: These are the most realistic items on your list. 15,000 XPF/month for dev tools and 30,000 XPF/month for internet/mobile for a small team is defensible.

Investor's View: An investor might question if the dev tools budget is sufficient for professional-grade error tracking and logging services (like Sentry, Datadog, etc.), which are crucial for a production platform.

Recommendation:

Combine "Development Tools" with a more professional approach. Re-label it "Professional Dev & Monitoring Tools" and increase it to 360,000 XPF.

Justify it: "Includes GitHub, software licenses, and essential monitoring services for real-time error tracking (e.g., Sentry) and uptime monitoring, allowing us to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users."

Keep "Telecommunications" as is. It's a solid number.

The Revised, Investor-Ready Tech Budget
Here is what your new, far more credible "Technological Infrastructure" section should look like.

Category	Recommended Annual Cost	Justification
Scalable Cloud Infrastructure	720,000 XPF	Production & staging environments, backups, peak load capacity.
External Technical Support & Contingency	600,000 XPF	Mitigates "key person risk" for emergency maintenance.
Professional Dev & Monitoring Tools	360,000 XPF	GitHub, licenses, and real-time error/uptime monitoring.
Telecommunications	360,000 XPF	Fiber internet and mobile plans for the team.
Total Tech Infrastructure	2,040,000 XPF	

In Google Sheets exportieren
This new total is only slightly higher than your original estimate, but it tells a completely different story. It's a story of professionalism, planning for scale, and mitigating risk—exactly what an investor needs to see to have confidence in your operational capabilities.
