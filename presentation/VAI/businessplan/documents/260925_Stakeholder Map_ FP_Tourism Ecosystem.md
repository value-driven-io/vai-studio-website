## Layer 3: Challenges, Needs, and Desired States

### The Core

* **The Visitor & The Destination (*The Islands of Tahiti*)**  
  * **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
    * **For the Visitor (Pains & Needs):**  
      * **High Cost:** French Polynesia is a notoriously expensive destination. The cost of living is **39% higher** than in mainland France, and ancillary expenses (food, activities) can be a significant deterrent. A tourist spends an average of **380,000 XPF (€3,185)** per trip, *excluding* international airfare.    
      * **Evolving Expectations:** The modern tourist is more sophisticated, digitally connected, and seeks unique, authentic, and sustainable experiences beyond the stereotypical beach holiday. There is a growing demand for cultural immersion, eco-tourism, and adventure activities like hiking.    
      * **Logistical Complexity:** The multi-island nature of the destination can be complex to navigate, creating a need for seamless inter-island transport and well-organized itineraries.  
      * **Safety & Health Concerns:** While crime is low, visitors need assurance regarding safety from natural disasters (cyclones, tsunamis) and health risks.    
    * **For the Destination (Pains & Challenges):**  
      * **Environmental Vulnerability:** The destination's primary assets—its pristine lagoons and biodiversity—are under direct threat from climate change (coral bleaching, sea-level rise) and the impacts of tourism itself (pollution, waste, habitat destruction).  
      * **Risk of "Myth" Erosion:** The powerful "Tahitian Myth" of an untouched paradise is a core asset. Overtourism, environmental degradation, or cultural commodification risk diluting this image and devaluing the destination's brand.    
      * **Infrastructure Strain:** The concentration of tourism on a few key islands puts immense pressure on local infrastructure, including water supply, waste management, and transport.    
  * **Desired State & Objectives:**  
    * To be a world-leading destination for **inclusive and sustainable "slow tourism"**, where visitors have high-quality, authentic, and safe experiences.    
    * To have a tourism model that actively contributes to the **preservation and regeneration** of the natural and cultural heritage, ensuring the long-term viability of the destination's core assets.

### Public Sector Stakeholders

**Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
The primary challenge is managing the inherent dependency of French Polynesia's economy on its financial transfers, which amount to roughly **30% of GDP**. This creates a need to support local economic development (like tourism) to foster self-sufficiency, while still maintaining its sovereign responsibilities (defense, justice, security). It must also navigate the political complexities of its relationship with a pro-independence local government.  

**Desired State & Objectives:**  
To ensure the political and economic stability of its overseas country. A key objective is to see tourism generate enough revenue to lessen the territory's reliance on direct financial aid from Paris. It also aims to support major infrastructure projects through agencies like the AFD to facilitate this growth and maintain its strategic influence in the region.

* **Government of French Polynesia & Key Agencies**  
  * **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
    * **Conflicting Strategies:** A major internal conflict exists between the officially adopted *Fāri'ira'a Manihini 2027* (FM27) strategy, which caps tourism at a sustainable 280,000 visitors, and the new government's stated ambition to reach 600,000 tourists.    
    * **Infrastructure Deficit:** A critical need to upgrade essential public services (water, sanitation, waste management) and transport infrastructure, which are currently insufficient to handle a significant increase in tourist numbers.  
    * **Derelict Tourist Sites:** Frustration with the slow pace of public policy in dealing with abandoned tourist sites (*friches touristiques*), which pose environmental and safety risks and are difficult to rehabilitate due to complex land ownership issues.  
    * **Labor Market Mismatch:** A persistent difficulty in structuring the labor market to supply the quantity and quality of skilled workers needed by the industry, a tension that would be severely exacerbated by rapid growth.    
    * **Need for Better Data:** A recognized need for more robust data collection, including the creation of a tourism satellite account and regular satisfaction surveys, to effectively manage the sector.    
  * **Desired State & Objectives:**  
    * **Economic Self-Sufficiency:** The primary driver for the 600,000 tourist goal is to generate sufficient local revenue to reduce the territory's long-standing financial dependency on the French State.    
    * **Sustainable & Inclusive Growth (FM27 Vision):** To position French Polynesia as a world leader in "inclusive and sustainable tourism" that benefits the local population, preserves the environment, and focuses on quality "slow tourism" experiences.    
    * **Diversification & Dispersal:** To diversify tourism products beyond the traditional beach holiday and expand visitor source markets (especially in Asia) to reduce reliance on North America and France. A key goal is to spread the economic benefits more evenly across all five archipelagos.    
* **Municipal & Archipelago Governance (Communes)**  
  * **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
    * **Centralized Decision-Making:** Frustration with a "Tahitian Jacobinism" where major tourism strategies are decided in Papeete without adequate consultation or consideration for local realities, leading to the suspension of local projects when central government priorities shift.    
    * **Strained Public Services:** Municipalities bear the burden of providing essential services (water, waste management) for a large tourist population but often lack the financial and technical resources to cope, especially without direct financial support for hosting tourism projects.    
  * **Desired State & Objectives:**  
    * **Greater Autonomy & Local Control:** To have more power in planning and decision-making for tourism development within their own communities, as exemplified by Bora Bora's unilateral implementation of a cruise passenger cap.    
    * **Adequate Funding:** To receive financial transfers proportional to the tourism pressures they manage, enabling them to upgrade and maintain essential infrastructure.    
    * **Sustainable Local Development:** To ensure tourism development improves the quality of life for residents and does not degrade the local environment.    
* **Tahiti Tourisme (DMO):**  
  * **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**   
    * Faces the challenge of marketing a high-cost destination in a competitive global market. It must constantly balance promoting growth with the government's sustainability goals, which can be conflicting (e.g., the 280k vs. 600k visitor debate). It also needs to diversify markets beyond the heavy reliance on North America and France to reduce risk.    
    * **Need for Actionable Data:** Need better data to make informed decisions. There is a recognized need for a formal tourism satellite account and more frequent, detailed surveys on visitor satisfaction and resident sentiment to guide policy.  
  * **Desired State & Objectives:**  
    * **Tahiti Tourisme (DMO):** To successfully brand *The Islands of Tahiti* as the world's premier destination for **inclusive and sustainable tourism**. Their goal is to diversify into high-value niche markets (diving, culture, eco-tourism) and new geographic markets (especially Asia) while leveraging digital tools for more effective, targeted marketing.  
* **Service du Tourisme (Tourism Service):**   
  * **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**   
    * Tasked with regulation and planning, it is often under-resourced to effectively manage and monitor the entire industry across 118 islands. It faces the complex challenge of implementing national strategies (like FM27) while dealing with local resistance and the practical limitations of infrastructure on the ground. There is a need to clarify its relationship and missions relative to Tahiti Tourisme to improve efficiency.    
    * **Walking a Strategic Tightrope:** These agencies are caught between implementing the official FM27 strategy of sustainable, managed growth (280,000 tourists) and the new government's political ambition for rapid growth (600,000 tourists). This creates conflicting messages and operational uncertainty.  
  * **Desired State & Objectives:**  
    * **Service du Tourisme (Tourism Service):** To be a fully-resourced and effective regulatory body that ensures quality, safety, and compliance with the national strategy. A key objective is to professionalize all tourism sectors through clear standards, licensing, and accessible training, and to become the central authority for robust tourism data.

### Private Sector Stakeholders

**Overall Challenges & Pains:**   
The private sector's primary frustration is a **critical lack of supply**, particularly in hotel rooms, which constrains growth despite high demand (hotel occupancy was **74.5% in 2023**). This is compounded by an uncertain investment climate due to political and strategic instability. All operators face extremely high operating costs due to the territory's remoteness and reliance on imports. Furthermore, the sector is highly fragmented, with small local businesses struggling to compete and professionalize in the face of labor shortages and a growing digitalization gap.  

**Overall Desired State:**   
To operate in a stable, predictable environment with a clear long-term government strategy that encourages investment in new and upgraded infrastructure. The sector desires to expand capacity to meet demand, diversify its offerings to attract new markets, and strengthen local supply chains to reduce costs and economic leakage. Ultimately, the goal is a profitable and competitive industry that delivers the high-quality, authentic experiences the destination's brand promises.

**Accommodation Sector (Hotels & Pensions)**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs (with data):**  
  * **Intense Competition (Airlines):** The international airline market is highly competitive, with over **1 million seats** offered to the destination in 2023, putting pressure on fares and profitability for carriers like Air Tahiti Nui. Domestically, new entrants are challenging the historical operator, Air Tahiti.  
  * **Local Opposition (Cruises):** Facing significant backlash in key ports over concerns of over-tourism and environmental impact, leading to strict, locally-imposed passenger caps. Bora Bora has a limit of **1,200 cruise passengers per day**.  
  * **Environmental Scrutiny:** Increasing pressure to reduce the carbon footprint of both air travel and cruise operations.  
* **Desired State & Objectives:**  
  * **Market Leadership & Growth:** For airlines, to see sustained growth in passenger numbers. Air Tahiti Nui aims to maintain its market leadership of **42.7%** of international traffic.    
  * **Route Expansion:** To open new routes and strengthen existing ones to diversify source markets, particularly in Asia.    
  * **Managed Growth (Cruises):** To continue the strong growth trajectory, with a projected **25% growth by 2026**, supported by new infrastructure like the Papeete terminal, while working with authorities to manage local impacts.  

**Transportation Sector (Airlines & Cruises)**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs (with data):**  
  * **Intense Competition (Airlines):** The international airline market is highly competitive, with over **1 million seats** offered to the destination in 2023, putting pressure on fares and profitability for carriers like Air Tahiti Nui. Domestically, new entrants are challenging the historical operator, Air Tahiti.  
  * **Local Opposition (Cruises):** Facing significant backlash in key ports over concerns of over-tourism and environmental impact, leading to strict, locally-imposed passenger caps. Bora Bora has a limit of **1,200 cruise passengers per day**.

  * **Managed Growth (Cruises):** To continue the strong growth trajectory, with a projected **25% growth by 2026**, supported by new infrastructure like the Papeete terminal, while working with authorities to manage local impacts.  

**Experience Economy & Distribution (DMCs, Activity Providers, Agencies)**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
  * **Fragmentation & Competition:** This sector is highly fragmented, especially among local activity providers, making it difficult to compete with larger, more organized entities.  
  * **Digitalization Gap:** Many smaller, local operators lack the digital skills and tools to effectively market their services online and reach international customers directly, making them dependent on intermediaries.    
  * **Need for Diversification:** There is a constant need to innovate and develop new, high-quality experiences beyond the standard lagoon tour to meet evolving tourist demands for authenticity, adventure, and culture.    
  * **Regulatory Hurdles:** Complex regulations for licensing and operations can be a barrier, especially for small businesses.    
* **Desired State & Objectives:**  
  * To create a more structured and professionalized sector with a diverse portfolio of unique, sustainable, and high-quality activities.    
  * To empower local operators through training in digital marketing, sustainable practices, and business management, enabling them to be more competitive and independent.    
  * To be key partners in developing new tourism products envisioned by the FM27 strategy, such as "memory trails" and eco-parks.  

#### ///// Deep Dive: Challenges, Needs & Frustrations of Activity Providers ////

This group, which includes everything from lagoon tour operators and dive masters to hiking guides and cultural workshop hosts, faces a unique and complex set of challenges that can be broken down into several key areas:

**1\. Financial and Economic Pressures (The Margin Squeeze)**

This is the most immediate and constant source of frustration for small operators. They are caught between high operational costs and a distribution system that erodes their profitability.

* **High OTA Commissions:** To gain visibility in the international market, many small operators are forced to list on major Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Viator, GetYourGuide, or Expedia. These platforms charge substantial commission rates, typically ranging from **15% to over 25%** of the booking price. For a small, family-run business, giving up a quarter of their revenue is a significant financial burden.   
* **Pressure from Intermediaries:** Beyond OTAs, operators also rely on hotel concierges and local Destination Management Companies (DMCs) for bookings. These intermediaries also take a commission, further squeezing the operator's margins. This creates a feeling of being a "price-taker" rather than a "price-setter."  
* **Complex International Payments:** Many small operators are not equipped to easily process international credit card payments in multiple currencies. They may lack sophisticated point-of-sale systems or face high fees from local banks. This creates friction for international customers who expect seamless digital payments.   
* **Currency Conversion & Payout Delays:** Even when using global platforms, the financial logistics are a major pain point. An operator's services are priced in Pacific Francs (XPF), but they might be paid out by an OTA in USD or EUR weeks or even months after the service is delivered. They then lose a percentage on the currency conversion back to XPF, the only currency they can use to pay local staff, buy fuel, and purchase supplies. This creates cash flow uncertainty in an already seasonal business.   
* **Extremely High Operating Costs:** The remote nature of the islands means nearly everything is imported, leading to high costs for essential business inputs:  
  * **Fuel:** For boat tour operators, the high cost of fuel is a major and volatile expense.  
  * **Equipment & Maintenance:** Spare parts for boats, 4x4 vehicles, or diving equipment are expensive and have long lead times for delivery.  
  * **Insurance:** Business liability insurance is a significant fixed cost.

**2\. The Digital Ecosystem and Visibility Battle**

In the modern travel market, visibility is everything. For small Polynesian operators, the digital world is both a necessity and a major source of frustration.

* **The Digital Divide:** There is a significant knowledge and resource gap. While large companies have dedicated marketing teams, a local tour guide is an expert on the lagoon or the valley, not necessarily on Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Ads, or social media content strategy. The government itself recognizes this gap, with connection rates for small businesses at only 72% compared to 100% for large ones.   
* **Lack of Online Autonomy:** This digital divide forces a dependency on OTAs. Many operators lack a professional, bookable website of their own, making them completely reliant on third-party platforms for online presence. Government aid for digital creation (ACN) exists, but navigating the application process can be a challenge in itself for a small business owner.   
* **Competition for Eyeballs:** A small operator's website or social media page is competing directly with the multi-billion dollar advertising budgets of Expedia and Booking.com, who often bid on the same keywords. This makes it incredibly difficult for a small business to be seen by potential customers during their trip planning phase.  
* **"Global" Support for Local Problems:** When issues arise with a global booking platform, the support offered is often generic and not tailored to the specific realities of operating in French Polynesia. There is a need for more localized, accessible support that understands the unique challenges of the *fenua* (the land/islands). 

**3\. Operational and Logistical Hurdles**

The day-to-day reality of running a tour business in a remote island chain presents constant challenges.

* **Dependency on Transport Links:** The entire business model for an operator in the outer islands depends on the flight schedules of the domestic airline duopoly (Air Tahiti and Air Moana). A single flight cancellation due to weather or technical issues can wipe out an entire day's revenue, leaving the operator with no recourse.   
* **Seasonality and Unpredictable Income:** The pronounced high season (July-September) and low season (January-February) create a "feast or famine" business cycle. This makes it difficult to manage cash flow, retain skilled staff year-round, and plan for long-term investments.   
* **Lack of Diversification:** The market has historically been heavily focused on a few core activities (e.g., lagoon tours, shark/ray feeding). While there is a growing demand for new experiences like hiking, cultural tours, and eco-tourism, developing and marketing these new products requires investment, training, and overcoming potential land access issues, which is difficult for small operators.   
* **Regulatory Burden:** Navigating the licensing, safety certifications, and tax requirements from the *Service du Tourisme* and other bodies can be a complex and time-consuming administrative burden for individuals whose primary skill is guiding, not paperwork. 

**Desired State & Objectives for Activity Providers:**

* **Direct Access to Market:** Their ultimate goal is to have more direct bookings to reduce commission-related revenue loss. This requires better, more accessible tools and training to build their own online presence and marketing capabilities.  
* **Simplified & Fair Financial Systems:** They need simple, low-cost solutions for accepting international payments and a system for faster payouts in their local XPF currency, reducing their exposure to currency fluctuations and improving cash flow.  
* **A Level Playing Field:** They desire a digital ecosystem where they can be more visible and compete on the quality of their experience, not just the size of their marketing budget. This includes more support from entities like Tahiti Tourisme to feature and promote small, authentic operators.  
* **Professional Development & Support:** There is a strong need for accessible, practical training in digital marketing, business management, sustainable practices, and English language skills to help them professionalize their operations and meet the expectations of international visitors.   
* **A Collaborative & Structured Sector:** They wish for a more organized sector with stronger local associations that can advocate for their interests, share best practices, and collaborate on creating new, innovative tour products that spread the economic benefits more widely.

//////////////////////////

**Ancillary & Support Sectors (Retail, Dining, Artisans, Local Suppliers)**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
  * **High Economic Leakage:** Heavy reliance on imported goods for restaurants, hotels, and retail means a significant portion of tourist spending "leaks" out of the local economy.  
  * **Supply Chain Gaps:** Local producers (agriculture, fisheries) often struggle to meet the volume, consistency, and quality standards required by the large international hotels, creating a disconnect in the local supply chain.    
  * **Competition for Artisans:** Local craftspeople face competition from cheaper, imported souvenirs and need better channels to access the high-value tourist market.  
* **Desired State & Objectives:**  
  * To significantly **reduce economic leakage** by strengthening local supply chains and fostering "buy local" partnerships between the tourism industry and local producers.    
  * To have a thriving and integrated local economy where tourism directly supports local farmers, fishermen, and artisans, ensuring a larger share of revenue is retained and circulated within the community.    
  * To see local products and crafts celebrated as a core part of the authentic visitor experience.

---

### The Local Community

**General Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:** 

* **Negative Social & Environmental Impacts:** Frustration over strained public services, pollution, and the degradation of lagoons. A significant issue is the creation of abandoned tourist hotels (*friches touristiques*) that block public access to the seaside, creating a "double penalty" for residents. \* **Exclusion & Socio-Economic Inequity:** A sense of being excluded from the economic benefits of high-end tourism, with skilled jobs often held by expatriates. This contributes to significant poverty;    
* **16% of the population lives below the poverty line**, and an estimated **75,000 people live on less than $600 per month**. \* **High Cost of Living:** The tourism-focused economy contributes to a high cost of living. A 2016 study found that overall consumer prices were **39% higher** than in mainland France.    
* \* **Loss of Authenticity & Cultural Commodification:** A deep-seated concern that a focus on mass tourism could dilute and commodify the very culture that makes the destination unique and valuable.    
* **Desired State & Objectives:** \* **Inclusive & Equitable Tourism:** A tourism model that prioritizes the well-being of the Polynesian people, provides quality jobs, creates entrepreneurial opportunities, and ensures economic benefits are widely distributed throughout the communities.    
* \* **Preservation of Culture & Environment:** To ensure that tourism development protects and enhances the natural environment and cultural heritage for future generations, integrating traditional practices like *rāhui*.    
* \* **Maintain Social License & Be Heard:** To have their voices and concerns respected in the development process, ensuring tourism grows with the consent and support of the host community. The "co-constructed" nature of the FM27 strategy is a step toward this goal.  

**The Workforce**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
  * **Lack of Advancement Opportunities:** A primary frustration is the perception of a "glass ceiling," where the best-paying and management-level positions are often filled by expatriates, leaving lower-skilled, lower-wage roles for locals.  
  * **Skills & Training Gap:** There is a critical need for more accessible and relevant vocational training programs to equip the local workforce with the skills required for career advancement in a high-end tourism market.  
  * **Wage vs. Cost of Living Squeeze:** Wages in the service sector often fail to keep pace with the high cost of living, which is itself inflated by the tourism economy. This makes it difficult for workers to achieve a decent quality of life, with **16% of the population living below the poverty line**.  
* **Desired State & Objectives:**  
  * To have a well-trained, local workforce filling roles at **all levels** of the industry, including senior management.  
  * To achieve the FM27 target of **13,000 quality tourism jobs** that provide stable, year-round employment, fair wages, and clear pathways for career progression.  

**Local Entrepreneurs (*Pension* Owners, Small Activity Providers, Artisans)**

**Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**

* **Imbalance of Power:** They face direct competition from large, international hotel chains and tour operators who possess vastly greater financial and marketing resources, making it difficult to compete for visibility and bookings.  
* **Dependency on Gatekeepers:** Their businesses are highly dependent on the domestic airline duopoly for tourist access to their islands and on OTAs/DMCs for bookings. This makes them vulnerable to flight schedule changes, price hikes, and high commission rates that erode their profitability.  
* **Lack of Business Support:** A strong need for more targeted support in crucial areas like digital marketing, financial management, accepting international payments, and navigating complex government regulations.  
  **Desired State & Objectives:**  
* To run profitable, sustainable businesses that are recognized as the heart of the authentic Polynesian visitor experience.  
* To gain more direct market access through improved digital skills and dedicated platforms, reducing reliance on high-commission intermediaries.  
* To be better integrated into the main tourism value chain through fair and reliable partnerships with hotels and DMCs, ensuring a more equitable distribution of tourism revenue across the islands.

**Cultural Custodians & Social Acceptability**

* **Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**  
  * **Exclusion and "Double Penalty":** Frustration over the privatization of the most beautiful coastal areas by resorts and the existence of derelict hotel sites (*friches touristiques*) that block public access to the lagoon, effectively penalizing residents twice.  
  * **Strain on Community Resources:** The direct impact of tourism on essential services like water and waste management, and the feeling that residents bear the costs while a select few reap the benefits.  
  * **Cultural Commodification:** A deep-seated fear that a focus on mass tourism will dilute and commercialize sacred traditions, turning authentic culture into a superficial performance for tourists.  
  * **Lack of Voice:** A feeling of being excluded from the top-down decision-making processes in Papeete that directly impact their lives and environment.    
* **Desired State & Objectives:**  
  * A "co-constructed" tourism model where the local population is a genuine partner in planning and governance, ensuring their "social license" to operate is maintained.    
  * A tourism industry that respects, protects, and actively helps to perpetuate local culture and traditions, integrating practices like *rāhui* (traditional resource management) into its operations.    
  * To see tangible improvements in community well-being and quality of life as a direct result of tourism development.

---

### Enablers and Influencers

**Challenges, Problems, Frustrations & Needs:**

* **Pervasive Environmental Threats:** Facing a wide range of systemic threats to the ecosystems they work to protect, including climate change (sea-level rise, coral bleaching), overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction from coastal development.    
* **Ineffective Top-Down Management:** Frustration with top-down government regulations that can be difficult to implement and enforce across the vast and diverse territory.    
* **Need for Funding & Support:** A constant need for funding and partnerships to carry out their conservation and cultural preservation work. For example, the NGO Oceania receives **60%** of its funding from public grants.  

**Desired State & Objectives:**

* **Large-Scale Conservation:** To establish large, legally protected Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to safeguard biodiversity and restore ocean health.    
* **Community-Based Management:** To empower local communities to manage their own resources through traditional practices like *rāhui*, supported by scientific expertise.    
* **Stronger Partnerships:** To build deeper collaborations with the government and private sector to integrate conservation and cultural preservation directly into the tourism model.

## Layer 4: Over-Arching Challenges & Tensions of the Status Quo

### 1\. The "Myth vs. Reality" Gap

This is a pervasive, cross-cutting tension affecting nearly every stakeholder.

* **Conflict/Frustration:** There is a significant and growing gap between the globally marketed "Tahitian Myth" of a pristine, untouched, and carefree paradise and the lived reality for both residents and visitors.  
* **Stakeholders Affected:**  
  * **The Local Community:** Is frustrated that the "paradise" image masks significant socio-economic challenges, including a high cost of living (39% higher than mainland France) and a poverty rate of 16%.  
  * **The Visitor:** Can experience a disconnect between the marketing promise and the reality of high costs for ancillary services, strained infrastructure in some areas, and the visible presence of derelict tourist sites.  
  * **Tahiti Tourisme:** Faces the immense challenge and frustration of maintaining this valuable but fragile brand image in the face of these realities.  
  * **Private Sector Stakeholders:** Are under constant pressure to deliver a "paradise" experience while grappling with extremely high operational costs and infrastructure limitations that are beyond their control.  

### 2\. The Paralysis of Land Ownership and Derelict Infrastructure

This is a deep, structural problem that acts as a major brake on the entire ecosystem.

* **Challenge/Frustration:** Complex, often unresolved, and culturally sensitive land ownership issues are a primary cause of failed tourism projects. This has resulted in a significant stock of abandoned and decaying tourist sites (*friches touristiques*) across the islands.  
* **Stakeholders Affected:**  
  * **Government of French Polynesia:** Is frustrated by the "slowness of public policies" and its inability to act quickly to rehabilitate these sites, which become environmental hazards and public eyesores.  
  * **Private Sector Stakeholders (Investors):** Are strongly deterred from new hotel development due to the high risk, legal complexity, and potential for community conflict associated with securing land.  
  * **The Local Community:** Suffers a "double penalty": first, the privatization and loss of access to prime coastal land for the project, and second, being left with the abandoned, decaying structures that further block access and degrade the local environment.

### 3\. The Public vs. Private Sector Labor Drain

This is a specific economic phenomenon that goes beyond a simple "labor shortage."

* **Challenge/Frustration:** The tourism industry struggles to compete for skilled labor against the higher, more stable salaries of the public sector, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as a localized "Dutch Syndrome".    
* **Stakeholders Affected:**  
  * **Private Sector Stakeholders:** Face a chronic challenge in recruiting and retaining qualified staff, which impacts service quality and drives up labor costs.  
  * **The Workforce:** Is often forced to choose between more secure and better-paying (but limited) public sector jobs and more abundant but often lower-paying and seasonal tourism jobs. This creates a structural barrier to building long-term, high-value careers within the tourism industry.

### 4\. The Paradox of "Authenticity" and the Tourist Gaze

This is a subtle but profound socio-cultural conflict at the heart of the visitor experience.

* **Conflict/Frustration:** The very act of seeking and consuming "authentic" cultural experiences can lead to their commodification. Furthermore, research reveals a "lack of solidarity" where some tourists, in their desire to preserve the "exotic" environment, may subconsciously prefer that local living conditions remain precarious to prevent development that could spoil their vacation view.  
* **Stakeholders Affected:**  
  * **Cultural Custodians (Local Community):** Face the constant challenge of sharing their heritage without it becoming a superficial performance, leading to a deep-seated fear of losing cultural integrity.    
  * **The Visitor:** May unknowingly contribute to this dynamic, seeking an "authentic" interaction that is, by its nature as a commercial transaction, curated.  
  * **Local Entrepreneurs:** Must navigate the difficult balance of providing the "authentic" experience tourists pay for while managing the realities of their own lives and businesses.

### 5\. The Inter-Archipelago Economic Imbalance

This goes beyond the central vs. local government tension and highlights a conflict between the island groups themselves.

* **Challenge/Frustration:** The tourism economy is overwhelmingly concentrated in the Society Islands (Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora), which host nearly 90% of the hotel capacity. This creates a significant economic disparity with the other four archipelagos.    
* **Stakeholders Affected:**  
  * **Local Communities & Entrepreneurs (Tuamotus, Marquesas, Australs, Gambier):** Are frustrated by being largely excluded from the primary economic engine of the country. Their small-scale tourism economies are almost entirely dependent on the fragile and expensive domestic air link for a small number of visitors.  
  * **Government of French Polynesia:** Faces the immense political and logistical challenge of fulfilling its strategic goal of "dispersing" tourism benefits, which requires massive investment in infrastructure to make the outer islands viable destinations.

**Domestic Airlines:** Are caught in the middle, pressured by the government to service unprofitable routes for the public good, which creates financial strain and operational challenges.

## Layer 5: Key Relationships, Connections & Tensions

This layer is divided into two parts: first, the relationship of each primary stakeholder group *to the Core*, and second, the relationships *between each other.* The *third highlights important further* relationships, Connections & Tensions with perspective on Inter-Stakeholder Dynamics which are important to mark.

### Part 1: Relationships to "The Core: The Visitor & The Destination"

* **Public Sector Stakeholders → The Core**  
  * **Connection (Governance & Promotion):** This sector acts as the primary manager and marketer of **The Core**. It regulates the **Visitor** experience through laws and standards (visa requirements, safety regulations) and shapes the image of **The Destination** globally through the marketing efforts of **Tahiti Tourisme**. The national strategy,    
  * *Fāri'ira'a Manihini 2027*, is the formal expression of this management role.    
  * **Tension (Balancing Act):** The primary tension is the need to attract **Visitors** for economic revenue versus the responsibility to protect **The Destination's** fragile environmental and cultural assets from the negative impacts of those same visitors. This is exemplified by the conflicting goals of increasing visitor numbers while promoting "slow tourism".  
* **Private Sector Stakeholders → The Core**  
  * **Connection (Service Delivery):** This sector is the operational engine that delivers **The Destination** to the **Visitor**. It provides the tangible products and services—flights, accommodations, tours, meals—that constitute the actual tourism experience. This relationship is fundamentally transactional.    
  * **Tension (Quality vs. Profitability):** The private sector's need for profitability can create tension with the quality of the **Visitor** experience and the health of **The Destination**. High operating costs can pressure operators, while a lack of hotel supply creates bottlenecks, potentially impacting service quality and visitor satisfaction.  
* **The Local Community → The Core**  
  * **Connection (The Living Essence):** The **Local Community** is not just a participant; it *is* the authentic essence of **The Destination**. They are **The Workforce** that powers the industry, the **Cultural Custodians** who provide the unique Polynesian experience (*Mana*), and the hosts who welcome the **Visitor**.    
  * **Tension (Host vs. Burden):** This is a deeply personal relationship. The **Local Community** directly experiences the tension between the economic benefits brought by the **Visitor** and the burdens placed on their daily lives, such as strained public services, a high cost of living, and the risk of cultural commodification.  
* **Enablers & Influencers → The Core**  
  * **Connection (Guardianship & Stewardship):** This group acts as the guardian of **The Destination's** most valuable assets. **Environmental & Cultural Stewards** like **NGOs** and **UNESCO** work to protect the natural and cultural heritage that attracts the **Visitor** in the first place.    
  * **Tension (Preservation vs. Access):** The core tension lies in their mission to preserve and protect **The Destination** versus the desire of the **Public and Private Sectors** to develop it for greater **Visitor** access. Their advocacy for conservation can be seen as a barrier to economic growth by other stakeholders.

---

### Part 2: Relationships Between Primary Stakeholders

* **Public Sector Stakeholders ↔ Private Sector Stakeholders**  
  * **Connection (Symbiotic Dependency):** The **Public Sector** needs the investment, jobs, and tax revenue from the **Private Sector** to achieve its economic goals. The **Private Sector** needs favorable regulations, infrastructure, and a stable investment climate from the **Public Sector** to operate profitably.    
  * **Tension (Policy vs. Profit):** The **Public Sector's** conflicting strategies (280k vs. 600k tourists) create significant uncertainty for **Private Sector** investors. Conversely, the **Private Sector's** drive for profit can clash with the **Public Sector's** sustainability goals, leading to friction over environmental standards and labor policies.  
* **Public Sector Stakeholders ↔ The Local Community**  
  * **Connection (Governance & Co-Construction):** The **Public Sector** governs on behalf of the **Local Community**. Strategies like FM27 are officially "co-constructed" with the population to ensure tourism development is inclusive and benefits residents.    
  * **Tension (Centralization vs. Local Reality):** A major friction point where the **Local Community** (especially in outer islands) feels that decisions made in Papeete do not reflect their needs. This leads to a loss of the "social license to operate" when residents feel they bear the costs of tourism (strained services, environmental damage) while the benefits are not equitably shared.  
* **Private Sector Stakeholders ↔ The Local Community**  
  * **Connection (Economic Engine):** The **Private Sector** is the primary employer of **The Workforce** and the main customer for **Local Entrepreneurs** (pension owners, activity providers, artisans), creating a direct economic link.    
  * **Tension (Inequity & Impact):** A critical tension exists over the distribution of economic benefits, with a perception that large, foreign-owned businesses capture most of the value, leaving locals with lower-wage jobs. Furthermore, the **Private Sector's** operations (e.g., resort construction, cruise ship arrivals) have direct social and environmental impacts on the **Local Community**.  
* **Enablers & Influencers ↔ Public & Private Sectors**  
  * **Connection (Collaborative Partnership):** A growing trend of collaboration exists, where **NGOs** partner with both the **Public Sector** (on policy) and **Private Sector** (on projects like coral nurseries or eco-tours) to advance shared sustainability goals.    
  * **Tension (Advocacy vs. Development):** The fundamental conflict between the **Enablers'** mission to preserve and the development goals of the other sectors. **Environmental & Cultural Stewards** often act as a critical watchdog, challenging projects and policies they deem harmful to the ecosystem, creating an adversarial dynamic.  
* **Enablers & Influencers ↔ The Local Community**  
  * **Connection (Empowerment & Shared Values):** These groups are natural allies. **NGOs** often empower the **Local Community** with scientific data and organizational support to manage their own resources, such as reviving the traditional practice of *rāhui*. They share a deep-rooted interest in the long-term cultural and environmental health of the islands.    
  * **Tension (Minimal):** While priorities can occasionally differ, this relationship is overwhelmingly collaborative and mutually reinforcing.

---

### Part 3: Further detailed Inter-Stakeholder Dynamics

* **Government of French Polynesia** ↔ **Private Sector Stakeholders (International Hotels & Resorts / International Airlines)**  
  * **Connection (Symbiotic Dependency):** The **Government** relies on the investment, jobs, and tax revenue from large hotel and airline corporations to meet its economic goals. The corporations need favorable regulations, tax incentives, and infrastructure from the **Government** to operate profitably.  
  * **Tension (Policy Instability vs. Investment Risk):** The **Government's** conflicting strategies (the official FM27 plan for 280,000 tourists vs. the political ambition for 600,000) create significant uncertainty. This instability is a major frustration for international investors and operators, who require a clear, stable, long-term vision to commit the large capital needed for new hotels and routes.  
* **Government of French Polynesia** ↔ **Municipal & Archipelago Governance**  
  * **Connection (Hierarchical & Financial):** The **Government** in Papeete sets the national tourism strategy and laws.    
  * **Municipalities** are responsible for implementing these on the ground and depend on financial transfers from the central government to provide essential services.    
  * **Tension (Centralization vs. Local Autonomy):** A core tension described as "Jacobinisme tahitien" exists, where **Mayors (*Tavana*)** feel their local realities and the capacity of their infrastructure are ignored by Papeete. This can lead to direct conflict, perfectly exemplified by the **Mayor of Bora Bora** unilaterally imposing a daily cap of 1,200 cruise passengers, directly challenging the national government's growth agenda.  
* **Accommodation Sector: International Hotels & Resorts** ↔ **Accommodation Sector: Tahitian Guesthouses (*Pensions de Famille*)**  
  * **Connection (Complementary Coexistence):** The two sectors can be complementary. The **International Hotels** build the destination's high-end brand image and secure the international air links that all tourism depends on. The **Tahitian Guesthouses** provide the authentic, cultural experiences that enrich the destination's overall appeal and allow for tourism in remote archipelagos. Some hotels actively partner with local guesthouses and activity providers for excursions.    
  * **Tension (Resource & Market Competition):** The two tiers compete for resources, particularly **The Workforce**. There is a significant risk that a development model focused solely on large-scale **International Hotels** could marginalize the vital, locally-owned **Pension** sector, which is crucial for retaining economic benefits within communities and preserving cultural authenticity.  
* **Private Sector Stakeholders (All)** ↔ **The Local Community**  
  * **Connection (Foundational Dependency):** This is the most fundamental relationship. The entire tourism industry is built upon the **Local Community's** assets: their land, the natural environment, their labor (**The Workforce**), and their culture (**Cultural Custodians**), which is the very "product" being sold to visitors.  
  * **Tension (The Social License to Operate):** This is the most critical tension in the ecosystem. The **Local Community** bears the negative impacts of tourism (strained public services, environmental degradation, high cost of living, loss of access to coastlines via *friches touristiques*). The economic benefits are often perceived as being concentrated among a few, with a "glass ceiling" preventing locals from reaching top management roles. If these negative impacts erode the community's goodwill and support, the authenticity and quality of the visitor experience are directly threatened, jeopardizing the entire industry's long-term viability.    
* **Private Sector Stakeholders (especially Cruise Lines & Developers)** ↔ **Enablers and Influencers (Environmental & Cultural Stewards)**  
  * **Connection (Adversarial & Collaborative):** **NGOs** often act as watchdogs, challenging development projects that threaten the environment. However, there is a growing trend of collaboration, with **International Hotels & Resorts** and **Cruise Lines** partnering with **NGOs** on conservation projects (e.g., coral nurseries, marine protection awareness) to enhance their sustainability credentials and brand image.    
  * **Tension (Preservation vs. Profit):** The fundamental conflict between developing land and sea resources for economic return versus preserving them for their ecological and cultural value. **Environmental Stewards** advocate for long-term ecological health and the precautionary principle, which can conflict with the short-to-medium-term profit motives of developers and the growth ambitions of the **Government**.  
* **Experience Economy & Distribution (OTAs)** ↔ **Local Entrepreneurs (Small Activity Providers)**  
  * **Connection (Visibility for a Price):** **International Travel Agencies & Wholesalers** (especially OTAs) provide essential global visibility and a booking platform for **Small Activity Providers** who lack the resources to market themselves internationally.  
  * **Tension (Economic Disempowerment):** This relationship is a major source of frustration for **Local Entrepreneurs**. They are forced into a state of dependency, paying high commission rates (15-25%+) to OTAs, which significantly erodes their profitability. This financial pressure is compounded by a digital divide and the feeling of being powerless against the marketing might of global platforms.
