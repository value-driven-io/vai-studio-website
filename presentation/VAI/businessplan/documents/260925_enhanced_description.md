## Status Quo Features

#### **VAI Operator: The Central Nervous System for Local Businesses**

VAI Operator is far more than a listing service; it is a complete business management platform offered for free to local operators.

**Core Functionality:** A suite of over 75 features allows operators to manage their entire business:

* **Tour & Schedule Management:** Create detailed listings and set complex recurring schedules.  
  * **Real-Time Booking Management:** A central dashboard to instantly confirm or decline bookings.

  * **The Channel Manager:** This feature allows an operator to create activities and manage their availability across **all their sales channels** (VAI, Viator, GetYourGuide, their own website) from one single calendar. This eliminates the \#1 operational headache \- double-bookings, and chaotic handling of last-minute cancellations \- and positions VAI as the indispensable central hub for their business. This feature turns competitors into data sources, and makes VAI the "stickiest" platform on the market without being a competition.  
  * **Free Marketing Channel:** The VAI Platform includes a free website (one-pager) for visibility globally. Easily to share and adapt.  
  * **Direct share of tours and activity on any other channel:** VAI doesn’t want to be exclusive, we support any Operator decision and help achieve them efficiently

* **Unified Discovery:** One app to find and book verified activities across all 118 islands.

**VAI Insights: The Data Hub**

VAI Insights is designed as a robust data analytics platform that provides operators and government agencies with real-time information on tourism activities. This enables data-driven decisions, improved economic planning, and proactive destination management.

**Social-Impact Contribution**

We are hard-wiring social responsibility into our calculations. **5% of our revenue** is dedicated to a fund for local environmental and cultural preservation projects, chosen in partnership with community leaders. This creates a virtuous cycle where tourism growth directly funds the protection of the assets it relies on.

## The Grand Vision: The VAI Ecosystem at Scale

**Our ambition is to become the “Operating System for Polynesian Tourism.”**  
 Tourism bookings are just the beginning. Once the core marketplace is established, we will expand into a full ecosystem designed around the essential needs of a thriving Polynesian economy:

* **VAI Insights – The Data Goldmine**  
   Anonymized, real-time data products for government bodies (*Tahiti Tourisme, Ministry of Tourism, Service du Tourisme*) and hotel groups. Insights into booking trends, demographics, and activity demand will enable **data-driven destination management for the first time**.

* **VAI Skills – The Education Hub**  
   Online courses and workshops for local entrepreneurs in partnership with communes and public institutions. Topics include digital marketing, sustainable practices, and financial literacy. Beyond a revenue stream, this strengthens the entire network and expands VAI’s impact into education.

* **VAI Homes – A Fair Alternative to Airbnb**  
   A platform for locally owned rentals, guesthouses (*pensions de famille*), and homestays. With **fairer commissions (10–12% vs. 15%+)**, rapid payouts, and features designed to foster cultural exchange, VAI Homes emphasizes authenticity over commoditization.

* **VAI Events – Showcasing Polynesian Culture**  
   A booking platform for festivals, retreats, and cultural experiences. It highlights local artists, musicians, and traditions, while offering visitors unique, authentic encounters.

* **VAI Connect – Empowering Communities, Together**  
   A social platform linking individuals, communities, and organizations. Through volunteering, donations, networking, and events, it fosters collaboration and lasting impact—built by the community, for the community.

* **VAI Maps – A Smarter Way to Explore**  
   An offline-capable, interactive map featuring curated trails, cultural sites, and local businesses. Designed for both visitors and locals, it enhances the experience while driving traffic to underrepresented destinations.

* **VAI Marketplace – Local Trade, Local Growth**  
   A platform for buying, selling, and trading within the Polynesian ecosystem. From second-hand kayaks to shared transport, it encourages **resource sharing and sustainability**.

* **VAI Supply – Strengthening Local Supply Chains**  
   A B2B marketplace connecting shops with local suppliers, reinforcing circular economy principles and reducing dependency on imports.

* **Ecosystem Expansion**  
   The same core technology will extend into new verticals such as restaurant reservations, wellness retreats, and equipment rentals.

* **Pacific Expansion**  
   The VAI model is scalable, serving as a template for other island nations facing similar challenges—unlocking regional and global growth potential.

Together, these services create powerful network effects—where each new layer enhances the value of the others. Our ultimate goal is to build a resilient **foundation for a thriving Polynesian ecosystem**.
