# **Strategic Communication Playbook**

**Overarching Principle of this document**  
 Every engagement begins by demonstrating understanding of the counterpart’s world. Communication starts with the challenges faced by the audience, not the product. The structure follows: challenges (XYZ) are recognized; the desired state (ABC) is clear; VAI is presented as the enabling tool to achieve it.

**In A Nutshell**

VAI is a locally-built company developing French Polynesia’s tourism operating system. Its mission is to empower local businesses, strengthen culture, and ensure that the value generated from tourism builds a resilient future for the fenua, with benefits retained within the community.

The strategy is not to compete with Viator, GetYourGuide, Airbnb, or Booking.com on market reach. The real competition is the **status quo of operational chaos, economic leakage, and digital invisibility** that weakens Polynesia’s tourism ecosystem. VAI is not just another OTA or booking system; it is a **holistic infrastructure** built on a fundamentally different business model.

The ecosystem starts with **VAI Operator**, enabling providers to manage availability across all their sales channels (Viator, GetYourGuide, their own website, and VAI) from a single calendar. But it extends far beyond that:

* **VAI Insights** brings real-time data to government and institutions for evidence-based tourism management.  
* **VAI Skills** closes the training gap with education for entrepreneurs.  
* **VAI Homes, Events, and Connect** promote authentic cultural exchange, community empowerment, and new revenue streams.  
* **VAI Supply and Marketplace** strengthen local supply chains and resource sharing, keeping more value in the islands.

The strategy is to build a value-driven ecosystem not only for local providers but also for the core tourism structure, where VAI naturally becomes the gateway to sustainable, community-centered tourism in French Polynesia.

## **1\. Activity Providers & Local Entrepreneurs**

**Core Problem**  
Activity providers and small entrepreneurs face structural financial disempowerment and operational chaos. They operate as price-takers, losing 20–35% of their revenues to international OTA commissions (Viator, GetYourGuide, FareHarbour), struggling with delayed and volatile international payments (30-60 days, often in Dollar or Euro), and suffering from digital invisibility (missing website, social media, booking system) when competing with global platforms. Administrative burdens (missing Channel Manager, often not automatically synchronized activities, chaotic manual work) and lack of digital tools further worsen the problem.

**Core Message**  
 VAI restores business control, improves profitability, and simplifies daily operations.

**Key Features**

* **VAI Operator**: A free, fair commission-based business management platform positioned as a supportive solution, not an additional cost.  
* **Secure International Payments**: Direct, weekly payouts in XPF that reduce cash flow volatility and eliminate currency conversion frustrations.  
* **Channel Manager**: A consolidated calendar to eliminate double-bookings, reframing OTAs as controllable sales streams.  
* **Free Marketing Channel**: Professional, bookable websites provided at no cost, addressing the “digital divide” and visibility challenges.  
* **5% Social Impact Contribution**: Collaboration with local social-impact organisations. **5% of VAI’s revenue** is dedicated to a fund for local environmental and cultural preservation projects, chosen in partnership with community leaders. This creates a virtuous cycle where tourism growth directly funds the protection of the assets it relies on.

**Evidence & Language**  
 Messages should reflect stakeholder vocabulary: “margin squeeze,” “high OTA commissions,” “digital divide.” References to real stories (e.g., paperwork burdens, delayed payments) help illustrate lived experiences.

**Positioning to Avoid**  
 VAI should not be framed as “just another booking site,” nor should complex data analytics dominate the message. The focus must remain on daily, tangible benefits and improved financial outcomes.

**Engagement Goal**  
 Encourage rapid setup of a free VAI Operator account, enabling direct, low-cost bookings within one week.

## **2\. Tahiti Tourisme**

**Core Problem**  
 Tasked with implementing the Fāri'ira'a Manihini 2027 (FM27) strategy, Tahiti Tourisme faces a significant digitalization gap and a lack of reliable data for measuring and managing progress.

**Core Message**  
 VAI provides the digital infrastructure that makes FM27 achievable, measurable, and sustainable.

**Key Features**

* **VAI Insights**: Fills the “data black hole” by delivering real-time, granular data on bookings, visitor flows, and trending experiences.

* **VAI Tickets & Operator**: Expands visibility and bookability for remote and small-scale operators, supporting diversification and dispersal of tourism.

* **VAI Skills**: Addresses training and professionalization gaps with collaborative educational programs on digital marketing, sustainability, and entrepreneurship.

**Evidence & Language**  
 Strategic terms aligned with FM27 should be used: “inclusive tourism,” “diversify experiences,” “strengthen local skills.”

**Positioning to Avoid**  
 Avoid competitive framing (e.g., “without partnership”). VAI must be positioned as an enabler of national strategy, not a competitor.

**Engagement Goal**  
 Establish dialogue and co-design a pilot program, positioning VAI as the official technology partner supporting FM27.

## **3\. Commune of Moorea**

**Core Problem**  
 Moorea faces centralization pressures (“Jacobinisme Tahitien”), desires greater autonomy over tourism, and struggles with strained public services while trying to preserve local identity.

**Core Message**  
 VAI strengthens Moorea’s economy by equipping entrepreneurs with tools to thrive and providing the commune with actionable tourism data.

**Key Features**

* **VAI Operator & Homes**: Enable pension owners and activity providers to retain more revenues locally, reducing leakage to international OTAs.

* **VAI Supply**: Connects tourism businesses directly with local producers, reinforcing the circular economy.

* **VAI Insights**: Provides Moorea-specific, anonymized data for visitor flows and infrastructure planning.

**Evidence & Language**  
 Communications should highlight “local control,” “sustainable local development,” and “keeping benefits on the island.” Moorea’s unique identity should be recognized and emphasized.

**Positioning to Avoid**  
 Avoid national framings; communications should focus exclusively on Moorea’s local context. VAI should be positioned as a decentralized solution supporting commune autonomy.

**Engagement Goal**  
 Co-launch a “VAI Moorea” initiative with workshops and onboarding support, establishing Moorea as a model for other Polynesian islands.

## **4\. Key Public Sector Stakeholders**

**Representative**: President Moetai Brotherson and the Government of French Polynesia.

**Core Problem**  
 The government must balance two conflicting goals: sustainable tourism under FM27 and ambitious growth targets of 600,000 visitors to support economic self-sufficiency and reduced dependency on France. Both require real-time, adaptable management tools.

**Core Message**  
 VAI is the data-driven steering mechanism for the tourism economy, enabling both sustainable growth and economic sovereignty.

**Key Features**

* **VAI Insights**: First real-time overview of the tourism ecosystem, supporting evidence-based planning and policy.

* **VAI Supply & Homes**: Mitigate economic leakage, empower local entrepreneurs, and strengthen supply chains.

**Engagement Goal**  
 Secure a high-level partnership aligning VAI with national strategic objectives, positioning it as the technological foundation of a prosperous and sovereign Polynesian economy.

## **5\. Local Community (Moorea Focus)**

**Core Problem**  
 Communities often experience tourism as a burden rather than a benefit, facing inequitable revenue distribution, cultural loss, and exclusion. At the same time, they aspire to create sustainable futures for younger generations.

**Core Message**  
 VAI empowers families to develop businesses, preserve culture, and ensure revenues stay within the community.

**Key Influencers**

* **Pension de Famille Owners**: Respected leaders whose endorsement validates VAI by demonstrating tangible benefits (lower commissions, faster payments, fewer double-bookings).

* **Cultural Custodians & Associations**: Guardians of traditions and environment, key allies for authentic experience promotion and future HINA Fund initiatives.

* **Respected Elders (Matahiapo)**: Require a values-based, culturally sensitive approach to gain trust and endorsement.

**Evidence & Language**  
 Communications must be grassroots in nature: informal gatherings, Tahitian phrases, emphasis on empowerment against external pressures.

**Engagement Goal**  
 Build community partnerships and secure endorsements to ensure VAI tools serve family and cultural needs in Moorea.

## **6\. Funding Institutions (Sofidep, ADIE)**

### Core Topics

#### 1\. The Status Quo: A Market Primed for Disruption

French Polynesia's tourism industry is a **99 billion XPF** cornerstone of the economy, responsible for **18.1% of all jobs**. However, this vital sector is operating on an inefficient, fragmented, and inequitable foundation. This creates significant challenges for every key stakeholder, representing a clear market failure and a major investment opportunity.

**For Local Entrepreneurs (The Engine of Authenticity):**

* **The Challenge:** They are the heart of the visitor experience but are financially disempowered. They are caught in a "margin squeeze," losing **15-25% of their revenue** to foreign OTA commissions. They struggle with complex international payments, delayed payouts, and currency conversion losses, creating severe cash flow uncertainty. Operationally, they are overwhelmed by the administrative burden of managing multiple booking channels, leading to costly double-bookings. Digitally, they are invisible, unable to compete with the massive marketing budgets of global platforms.

  **For the Public Sector (The Stewards of the Destination):**

  * **The Challenge:** The **Government of French Polynesia** and its agencies like **Tahiti Tourisme** are flying blind. They have a national strategy, FM27, but suffer from a "Data Black Hole," lacking the real-time data needed to manage the destination, measure their impact, or make informed policy decisions. They are trying to promote a diverse, sustainable destination, but their primary assets—the small, local operators—are struggling to be seen and to professionalize.  

  **For The Visitor (The Source of Revenue):**

  * **The Challenge:** They face "Logistical Complexity" and "High Costs." The fragmented market makes discovering and booking authentic local experiences difficult. The inefficiencies of the current system, especially high OTA commissions, are ultimately passed on to them, inflating prices in an already expensive destination.

  **For The Local Community (The Foundation of the Economy):**

  * **The Challenge:** The community suffers from "High Economic Leakage." A significant portion of the 99 billion XPF spent by tourists flows out of the country to international OTAs and for imported goods. This contributes to "Exclusion & Socio-Economic Inequity," where **16% of the population lives below the poverty line** despite the booming tourism sector.

**This is the situation today:** a system where the creators of authentic value are penalized, the managers of the destination lack the data to govern effectively, and the economic benefits are not fully realized by the community. This is the market failure VAI was built to solve.

#### 2\. The Future with VAI: The Operating System for Polynesian Tourism

VAI is not just another app; it is the central nervous system that connects and empowers every stakeholder in the ecosystem, creating a more efficient, equitable, and profitable tourism industry for all.

**For Local Entrepreneurs, VAI Solves:**

* **Financial Disempowerment:** VAI Operator is a **free** business management platform. Our integrated payment system handles international currencies and provides fast payouts in local XPF, dramatically improving cash flow and profitability.  
  * **Operational Chaos:** Our **Channel Manager** eliminates the \#1 headache—double-bookings—by creating a single, central calendar to manage all sales channels, from Viator to their own website.  
  * **Digital Invisibility:** We provide every operator with a **free, professional, bookable website**, giving them immediate global visibility and a direct channel to customers.

  **For the Public Sector, VAI Fulfills:**

  * **The Need for Better Data:** **VAI Insights** provides the first-ever real-time, anonymized dashboard of the entire tourism economy. This allows **Tahiti Tourisme** and the **Government** to make data-driven decisions, measure the impact of FM27, and manage the destination proactively.  
  * **The Goal of Inclusive Growth:** Our entire ecosystem—**VAI Skills, VAI Homes, VAI Supply**—is designed to empower the **Local Community**, professionalize **The Workforce**, and reduce economic leakage, directly aligning with the core principles of the national tourism strategy.  

  **For The Visitor, VAI Fulfills:**

  * **The Need for Seamless Discovery:** **VAI Tickets** provides a single, trusted platform to discover and book authentic activities across all 118 islands, with real-time availability and transparent pricing.

  **For The Local Community, VAI Fulfills:**

  * **The Need for Equitable Benefits:** By empowering **Local Entrepreneurs** and creating future platforms like **VAI Supply**, our model is designed to keep a larger share of the **99 billion XPF** tourism revenue circulating within the local economy, creating a more prosperous and resilient community.

By solving the core frustrations of the most vital players, VAI creates a powerful network effect, becoming the indispensable operating system for the entire industry. An investment in VAI is an investment in the sustainable and prosperous future of French Polynesia's most important economic sector.
