            "French Polynesia's **99 billion XPF tourism economy**, the nation's cornerstone, is responsible for **18.1% of all employment** and represents up to **14.7% of GDP**. However, this vital sector faces critical structural challenges that threaten its long-term sustainability, erode its social license to operate, and result in significant economic leakage to foreign entities. The current digital landscape is fragmented, inefficient, and inequitable, leaving local entrepreneurs disempowered and public institutions without the data needed for effective governance.",
            "VAI presents a locally-conceived, strategic intervention to address these challenges head-on. It is not merely a commercial enterprise, but a foundational piece of **Digital Public-Interest Infrastructure** designed to establish digital sovereignty, empower thousands of Polynesian entrepreneurs, and ensure the vast economic benefits of tourism are retained and reinvested within the Fenua.",
            "This document outlines a strategic plan for VAI. It details a systemic diagnosis of the current ecosystem, presents a robust framework for intervention through the VAI platform, and defines a clear doctrine for a responsible public-private partnership. The objective is to build a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous tourism economy for future generations."

            "**1. The \"Myth vs. Reality\" Gap:** A growing disconnect between the marketed image of an untouched paradise and the lived reality of a high cost of living (**39% higher than mainland France**), a **16% poverty rate**, and visible derelict infrastructure, which frustrates both residents and visitors.",
            "**2. The Paralysis of Land Ownership:** Complex and culturally sensitive land ownership issues have led to a significant stock of abandoned tourist sites (*friches touristiques*), creating environmental hazards, deterring investment, and imposing a \"double penalty\" on the local community who lose both access and environmental quality.",
            "**3. The Public vs. Private Sector Labor Drain:** The tourism industry's struggle to offer wages and stability competitive with the public sector creates a structural barrier to building a skilled, long-term local workforce.",
            "**4. The Paradox of \"Authenticity\":** The very act of seeking and selling \"authentic\" cultural experiences risks their commodification, creating a profound socio-cultural conflict for a community that fears losing its cultural integrity.",
            "**5. The Inter-Archipelago Economic Imbalance:** The overwhelming concentration of tourism in the Society Islands excludes the other four archipelagos from the primary economic engine of the country, creating significant regional disparity."
